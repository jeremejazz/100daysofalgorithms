# 100 Days of Algorithms


This repository contains notes and source codes for taking the 100 Days of Algorithms Challenge

In this challenge, I commit to learn algorithms using the following resource materials as reference:

- [Algorithmic Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Thinking-2nd-Problem-Based-Introduction-dp-1718503229/dp/1718503229)
- [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms-second-edition)

Each day I will be posting my progress topics I have learned in an hour. 

Updates will be posted on 
- LinkedIn
- Notion
